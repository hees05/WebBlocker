# 🛡️ SafeSurf Blocker — Chrome Extension  
*A tool to protect your future self from brainrot on the web.*

---

## 🚀 Overview  
**SafeSurf Blocker** is a Chrome Extension developed to help users surf the internet more mindfully in a world where attention is constantly under siege.

It blocks access to websites containing harmful, low-effort, or brain-melting content based on a list of predefined keywords. But it doesn’t just block — it speaks to you.

When you try visiting a restricted site:
> 🗣️ Emily (our AI voice assistant) explains why the page is blocked  
> 🎙️ Then asks you to say:  
> “I will not search up *<keyword>* again.”  
> 🙏 And finally —  
> You must say: “I’m sorry.” before you're allowed to go back.

It may sound odd, but sometimes reflection and friction are powerful tools for change.
