🛡️ SafeSurf Blocker — Chrome Extension
A tool to protect your future self from brainrot on the web.

SafeSurf Blocker is a Chrome Extension I built to help people surf the web a bit safer — especially in a world where everything is fighting for your attention (and not always in a good way).

It blocks access to websites with dangerous or low-effort keywords that are known to lead to… well, brainrot. It doesn’t just stop you — it talks to you. Literally.

When you hit a restricted page, Emily (an AI voice) pops up and tells you why this content is harmful. Then she asks you to repeat:

“I will not search up <keyword> again.”

And if you’re serious about bouncing?
You’ll need to say “I’m sorry” out loud too.

Funny? Yes.
Cringe? Maybe.
Effective? That’s the plan.

This is meant for the future of healthier minds online. A gentle nudge when your brain needs it.
